                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>First community meeting of the Nobodies Collecting Asociaci&oacute;n (NCA). The board presented the association's formation, the plan for a 2026 event, and how to get involved. The meeting showed strong community willingness to contribute, but also surfaced questions about decision-making timelines, the relationship with Going Nowhere S.L., and operational readiness.</p>

                    <h2>Board Presentations</h2>

                    <h3>Daniel &mdash; Why We're Here</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>72 community members elected the 8-member board in December</li>
                        <li>The association has been incorporated, tax ID filed, website created, bank account in progress</li>
                        <li>Acknowledged the board doesn't yet properly represent community diversity &mdash; to be addressed</li>
                        <li>The board handles legal/financial infrastructure; the community makes the event happen</li>
                        <li>Called on attendees to help grow from 8 to 80 to 800 people involved</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pablo &mdash; Association Structure</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NCA is a Spanish non-profit with no shareholders</li>
                        <li>Board elections every 2 years with term limits</li>
                        <li>Members can vote on major decisions (land purchase, statute changes)</li>
                        <li>In discussions with GNSL about acquiring assets (trademark, materials, files)</li>
                        <li>The two entities are strictly separate in governance and assets &mdash; NCA starts from scratch</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Ben &mdash; How to Get Involved</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ~65 people who voted in the election will be onboarded as members next week</li>
                        <li>Association membership will be opened gradually to maintain governance integrity</li>
                        <li>Association membership is NOT required to contribute to the event (volunteer, lead, camp, art, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Expression-of-interest form on nobodies.team</li>
                        <li>Acknowledged the timeline is tight (~5 months) and that historically, tight timelines have only worked with existing infrastructure in place</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pablo &mdash; Land Update</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A site has been selected (announced previously)</li>
                        <li>~250 people have expressed interest in contributing to land purchase</li>
                        <li>Nearly &euro;1M in community interest: ~&euro;900K in loans (at 2%, 4%, or 0% interest) and ~&euro;100K in donations</li>
                        <li>Diversely sourced: 90%+ of contributions are &euro;1,000&ndash;5,000</li>
                        <li>At &euro;750K purchase price, payback period would be 5&ndash;8 years</li>
                        <li>Land is targeted for 2027, not 2026</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Key Community Questions &amp; Concerns</h2>

                    <h3>Go/No-Go Decision</h3>
                    <p>Multiple attendees asked when and how a go/no-go decision would be made, and who makes it.</p>

                    <h3>Creativity &amp; Budget Needs</h3>
                    <p>The Creativity department raised that the art grant process needs to begin soon, which requires budget information. The Treasurer was identified as the contact for budget queries. No figures were available at the meeting.</p>

                    <h3>Relationship with Going Nowhere S.L.</h3>
                    <p>Multiple questions about GNSL's status, assets, and communications. The board stated:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assets (trademark, materials, documents, cash) belong to GNSL</li>
                        <li>NCA is in discussions about potentially acquiring assets</li>
                        <li>The goingnowhere.org website is not part of the new organization</li>
                        <li>GDPR constraints complicate any transfer of data or contacts</li>
                        <li>GNSL directors are also members of the association and part of the community</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Old Website &amp; Communications Confusion</h3>
                    <p>Several attendees noted that the old goingnowhere.org website contains no information about the transition, causing confusion among community members. Suggestions included asking GNSL to add an update, or replicating relevant content on the new site. The board acknowledged the new website is basic and open-source, and welcomed contributions to improve it.</p>

                    <h3>Do Leads Carry Over?</h3>
                    <p>Roles do not automatically transfer from the old organization. The board stated that the same experienced people are welcome to continue in practice, and that the board would like role selection to be more democratic going forward.</p>

                    <h3>Membership Process</h3>
                    <p>Some confusion about who is currently a member. The board clarified:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being on the call does not make someone a member</li>
                        <li>Election voters will be formally onboarded first</li>
                        <li>Criteria for broader membership will be proposed subsequently</li>
                        <li>The association only legally came into existence recently, so formal membership was not previously possible</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Assumptions About Participation</h3>
                    <p>Ubertown stated they have reservations and practical reasons they may need to take a fallow year, and noted concern about assumptions that all camps and infrastructure providers are on board.</p>

                    <h2>NCA/GNSL Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>NCA and GNSL are separate entities, but many community members (including GNSL directors) are involved in both. Some attendees found the separation confusing or asked questions that crossed the boundary. In the chat, GNSL directors noted they are attending as association and community members, not as representatives of the SL. Several attendees affirmed they see continuity between the old and new organizations and expressed appreciation for contributions made under both structures. The board referred to "an event in July" rather than using the "Nowhere" name, which is trademarked by GNSL.</p>

                    <h2>Community Commitments</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Camp leads indicated they are already preparing their camps</li>
                        <li>Build confirmed 100% participation</li>
                        <li>Comms leads from the previous organization indicated availability</li>
                        <li>FIST (volunteer shift system) confirmed usable under its open-source AGPL3 license</li>
                        <li>Previous low-income ticket coordinator offered to continue</li>
                        <li>Multiple expressions of appreciation for both the board's work and the previous organization's contributions</li>
                        <li>Land fundraising showed broad-based community support</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Action Items</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expression-of-interest form to go live on nobodies.team (Pablo, that evening)</li>
                        <li>Onboard the ~65 election voters as association members (next week)</li>
                        <li>Contact key leads and departments to assess availability</li>
                        <li>Provide budget information to Creativity and other departments</li>
                        <li>Continue GNSL asset acquisition discussions</li>
                        <li>Next community meeting: Wednesday, February 5, 2026</li>
                        <li>Discord and Telegram channels shared for ongoing conversation</li>
                    </ul>
